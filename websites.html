    <div class="child">This site was made about the popular 90s anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion. It is definitely one of my favorite anime series, besides Mob Psycho. Although, the site wasn't filled with much information; it served only to demonstrate me being able to code to the level of what was expected during that time in the course last year in 2023.<br><br> This is one of my site projects for my previous intro to HTML course at Skyline College. We had to use different kinds of positions, and I made the PNG images in my site static and not move while the page is being scrolled.</div>

    <div class="child">This site was the previous resume site made for this course, Interactive Design. I used a drawing I had made for my PC wallpaper, used it as the header, and used serif type in order to portray some sort of formalness. As you can see, I put false info, but it was solely to demonstrate the ability to code a simple reusme site.</div>
